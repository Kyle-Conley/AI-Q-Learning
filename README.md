â€¢	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, a portion of the .ipnyb file was provided along with two Python scripts. The existing code in the provided files laid the foundation for the Q-learning algorithm, which is a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning for creating intelligent agents. My task involved building upon this foundation and completing the Q-learning algorithm to create an intelligent agent to solve pathfinding problems. 


o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists play a vital role in addressing real-world problems. They are essentially problem solvers who utilize their technical expertise to create solutions for a wide range of challenges. From solving pathfinding problems to monitoring complex systems like power plants, computer scientists are responsible for designing and implementing software and infrastructure that streamline processes and enhance efficiency.


o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problem-solving by breaking down each complex problem into smaller, manageable components. This involves first understanding the objective and its requirements, then breaking it down into manageable problems and performing research to ensure all of the requirements will be met successfully, then I design my solution and implement acceptable coding practices. Throughout this process, testing is done to catch any errors before they turn into more complex problems. Finally, once I have solved and deployed my solution, it's imperative to get feedback and ensure functionality. 


o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My responsibilities as a computer scientist include but are not limited to, protecting the users' data and privacy by implementing advanced security measures and being transparent with users about what data is being collected and how it is being used. Additionally, I have an obligation to consider the social and economic impact of my design to ensure that it does not involve societal bias or economic differences.
